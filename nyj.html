 <h3>Racism</h3> 
 <p>Trevo Noah's paints a clear portrail of what it was like for him to grow-up during and afer apartheid in
    South Africa. His father was white, his mothers black and was called "colered". White and black
    interacting, besides in a working relationship was forbidden so Trevor even  existing was  
   proof of a significant crime. so that at times were force to shun and ignore him in order for
   them to survive. In chapter 1 The title "Born a Crime" refers to the fact that Trevor Noah was 
   born in South Africa during the apartheid era,when it was illegal for a black mother and a 
   white father to be together. He talks about how Patricia, his mother, was a strong, independent woman. 
   Trevor's early years and his connection with his mother are examined.Patricia gives 
   Trevor a strong sense of morality and independence despite the difficulties of poverty and apartheid.
   Through her bravery, resourcefulness, and navigating the oppressive system, she teaches Trevor important life skills.</p>

     <h3>Religion</h3>
      <p>For Noah's mother and, as he points out, a great deal of other disadvantaged peoples worldwide, religion is 
       an essential supply of relief and significance, it not only keeps them hopeful in the face of their
       remarkable hardship but also enables them to succeed in the a colonial environment by 
       adopting the practices of the settlers. As a devoted Christian,Noah's mother brings the family 
       to three churches on Sundays, which take up the entire day. She seems to think that the more churches she attends,
       the more blessings she would receive and the more probable it is that her prayers will be answered</p>
