    <h2>Born A Crime</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
    <h3>Racism</h3> 
    <p>Trevo Noah's paints a clear portrail of what it was like for him to grow-up during and afer apartheid in
    <br>South Africa. His father was white, his mothers black and was called "colered". White and black
    <br>interacting, besides in a working relationship was forbidden so Trevor even  existing was  
   <br>proof of a significant crime. so that at times were force to shun and ignore him in order for
    <br>them to survive. In chapter 1 The title "Born a Crime" refers to the fact that Trevor Noah was 
    <br>born in South Africa during the apartheid era,when it was illegal for a black mother and a 
    <br>white father to be together. He talks about how Patricia, his mother, was a strong, independent woman. 
   <br>Trevor's early years and his connection with his mother are examined.Patricia gives 
   <br>Trevor a strong sense of morality and independence despite the difficulties of poverty and apartheid.
   <br>Through her bravery, resourcefulness, and navigating the oppressive system, she teaches Trevor important life skills.</p>

     <h3>Religion</h3>
      <p>For Noah's mother and, as he points out, a great deal of other disadvantaged peoples worldwide, religion is <br>
       an essential supply of relief and significance, it not only keeps them hopeful in the face of their<br>
       remarkable hardship but also enables them to succeed in the a colonial environment by <br>
       adopting the practices of the settlers. As a devoted Christian,Noah's mother brings the family <br>
       to three churches on Sundays, which take up the entire day. She seems to think that the more churches she attends,<br>
       the more blessings she would receive and the more probable it is that her prayers will be answered</p>
